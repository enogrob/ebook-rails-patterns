# eBook Rails Patterns

![ebook image](assets/ebook.png)

**About**

**Introduction to Rails patterns** is a short book about Rails patterns. I believe that there is a lot more to say and write about those patterns but my main goal here was to introduce you to this subject. I went quickly over most popular and useful patterns, described naming and design rules along with short but yet useful use cases. This book is not dedicated to a certain group of developers when talking about the experience in general. For some, it will be just a reminder and for other a beginning of a long journey of refactoring code of their applications.
